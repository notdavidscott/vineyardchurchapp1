     <p> Every day, The Mercy Warehouse takes in tax-deductible donations of unwanted goods, clothing, and furniture. 
        We then sort and store them in our 20,000 square-foot facility. Our thrift store is open for sales every day. 
        We use the profits from those sales to purchase food for needy families both in our own area and abroad. 
        Through this process we are able to provide food for over 1000 people weekly. We fund monthly food donations to Mexico, 
        Los Angeles, and Santa Ana, and we also help to supply several other local food banks.

      We are a volunteer-run organization. Many members of our community give countless hours every week towards
       seeing the mission of The Mercy Warehouse fulfilled. We give away food to anyone who needs it on Wednesdays 
       and Fridays from 12:00 to 2:00 PM and on Mondays from 4:00 â€“ 6:00 p.m. </p>
